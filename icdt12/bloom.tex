\section{Context: Bloom}
Dedalus has been motivated by our concurrent work on \emph{Bloom}, a
domain-specific language (DSL) for distributed programming~\cite{bloom}. Unlike
Dedalus, Bloom is intended to be a practical programming language: we have used
Bloom to build a wide array of distributed protocols and several complete
applications, including a distributed file system. Bloom is a declarative
language in which computation is expressed as a collection of rules over
relations. Like sugared \lang, Bloom includes temporal operators that allow the
programmer to indicate when certain deductions should be deferred to the next
``timestep'' of the system or when deductions must cross a network
boundary. % XXX: connect Dedalus and Bloom more explicitly?

By developing Dedalus, our goal was to assign a model-theoretic semantics for
distributed logic programs and hence clarify the semantic ambiguities that have
complicated our prior work on distributed declarative programming
(e.g.,~\cite{Mao2009,navarro-oper-sem}). In addition, Dedalus has been essential
to the development of several program analysis tools for Bloom. Specifically,
our goal was to develop tools to help developers understand where their programs
required additional coordination in order to ensure deterministic
outcomes. Inspired by the CALM conjecture~\cite{cidr11,declarative-imperative},
Bloom's \emph{coordination analysis} tool identifies locations in the program's
dataflow graph where a non-monotonic operation is applied to a collection that
has been derived asynchronously (e.g., via communication).  Intuitively, an
asynchronously-derived collection contains at any time some nondeterministically
selected subset of its inputs, and a nonmonotonically-derived collection may
have different contents in different executions, if applied to different subsets
of its inputs.  Hence such locations are flagged as ``points of order:''
locations at which additional program logic (i.e., coordination) should be
supplied to ensure that all program executions (or operations on all replicas)
apply the non-monotonic operator to the same input set.
