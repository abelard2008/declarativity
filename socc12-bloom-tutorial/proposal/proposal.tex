\section{Introduction}

In recent years, distributed programming has become a topic of widespread
interest among developers. However, writing reliable distributed programs
remains stubbornly difficult. In addition to the inherent challenges of
distribution--- asynchrony, concurrency, and partial failure---many modern
distributed systems operate at massive scale. Scalability concerns have in turn
encouraged many developers to eschew strongly consistent distributed
storage~\cite{Birman2009,Helland2009}, which has raised the level of difficulty
still further.

In this tutorial, we will introduce \emph{Bloom}, a language for distributed
programming that we have developed at UC Berkeley~\cite{bloom-website}. We will
show how to use Bloom to develop well-known examples of distributed systems
infrastructure, including a key-value store, quorum replication, a distributed
lock manager, and a distributed commit protocol. While we believe that Bloom
allows declarative, concise, and readable implementations of these systems, our
emphasis will be on how the unique features of Bloom help programmers understand
the \emph{semantics} of their distributed programs. In particular, we will
discuss the \emph{CALM Theorem}, which establishes a connection between
\emph{logical monotonicity} and \emph{distributed
  consistency}~\cite{Alvaro2011,Ameloot2011,Hellerstein2010,dedalus-confluence}.
