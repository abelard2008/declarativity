1> Semantics of compound tuple: The versioning approach offers the slightly non-intutive behavior where a given locspec can contain multiple tuples of a given type with same key as the version (which is included in the implicit key) will be different for all such tuples.
Possible Sol: Include the table key in the locSpec table making the locSpecTable table specific. Thus the key for locSpec table will comprise of Node containing the version tuple(to avoid DOS attacks by attacker), node referencing the locSpec, locSpec, and the key for the referenced table (note that the version is now excluded from the key)1> The eca code needs to be changed to preserve the term ordering in the original rule.
2> Need to add the functions used in the compound tuple rewrite
