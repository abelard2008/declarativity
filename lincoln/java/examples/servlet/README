Support files for the lincoln.war web service stuff.

Compiling linoln.war:

cd $JOL
ant war

Running lincoln.war:

Download the newest 'core' version of tomcat 6.x from tomcat.apache.org.

mkdir ~/local
cd ~/local
tar -zxf /path/to/apache-tomcat-*.tar.gz
cd apache-tomcat-*
mv webapps/ webapps-examples
mkdir webapps
cp $JOL/ant-dist/lincoln.war webapps/
bin/startup.sh

Browse to: http://localhost:8080/lincoln/ 

Note that tomcat will accept connections from the internet on
the following ports:

8009
8005
8080  <-- http port

Mess with $TOMCAT/conf/server.xml if you want to change this.

Jol can open ports too:

8747  <-- Civil.java opens this as of this writing.

Mess with $JOL/examples/servlet/web.xml, re-run 'ant war' and deploy the new
lincoln.war to change this.

Re-running (aka: 'deploying') linclon.war:

cd ~/local/apache-tomcat-*
bin/shutdown.sh
rm -rf webapps/lincoln
cp $JOL/ant-dist/lincoln.war webapps/
bin/startup.sh

Adding your own servlet:

1) Use the boilerplate code in Civil.java as a starting point for your Servlet
   class.

2) Copy the Civil section of the web.xml in the same directory as this file,
   and edit it as needed.
