The Overlog source code can be found in:

src/olg

Core Paxos comprises two overlog files:

prepare.olg
propose.olg

Leader election is implemented in:

election.olg


For backward-compatibility reasons, we define the relation paxos::parliament (which reflects 
our view membership) here:

ident.olg

The other files are supplementary, and used to conduct tests:

insertions.olg
assertions.olg
