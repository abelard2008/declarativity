\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Concurrency control}
The importance of commutative operations has long been recognized by work in the
distributed systems, data management, and groupware communities.

\subsection{Non-monotonicity in deductive databases}
Adding non-monotonic operators (e.g., aggregation and negation) to Datalog
increases the expressiveness of the language but introduces significant
complexities: care must be taken to ensure that the resulting language has a
semantics that is well-defined, intuitive to the user, and amenable to efficient
evaluation. A straightforward approach is to disallow recursion through
aggregation or negation, which admits only the class of so-called ``stratified
programs''~\cite{Apt1988}. Many attempts have been made to assign a semantics to
larger classes of programs (e.g.,~\cite{Gelfond1988,Ross1990,VanGelder1991}).

The observation that many uses of aggregation and negation have a ``monotonic''
flavor has been made before.
