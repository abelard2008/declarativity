\section{Lattice Fundamentals}
\label{sec:foundation}

\begin{itemize}
\item define lattices and merge functions/LUBs
\item introduce \baselang, and give a model-theoretic semantics for it ($\to$
  ``what does it mean to compute a fixpoint of a \baselang program?'')
\item show that \baselang generalizes Datalog
\item presumably proving confluence of \baselang would be too involved (e.g.,
  would require introducing Dedalus, etc.)
\end{itemize}
