In this section, we consider a simple e-commerce system in which clients
interact with a shopping cart service, adding and removing items over the course
of their browsing session (Figure~\ref{fig:cart-system}). The shopping cart
service is replicated to improve fault tolerance; client requests can be
submitted to any of the cart replicas. Eventually, a client submits a
``checkout'' operation, at which point the cumulative effect of their shopping
session should be summarized and returned to the client. In a more complete
system, the result of the checkout operation might be presented to the client
for confirmation or submitted to a payment processor to complete the e-commerce
transaction. This case study is based on the cart system from Alvaro et
al.~\cite{Alvaro2011}, which was in turn inspired by the discussion of
replicated shopping carts in the Dynamo paper~\cite{DeCandia2007}.

Alvaro et al.\ consider two different cart designs: a ``disorderly'' version in
which the cart state is represented as a set (allowing monotonic accumulation of
add/remove operations) and a ``destructive'' version in which the cart state is
managed by a key-value store, which requires a non-monotonic update on each cart
action. In both designs, Alvaro et al.\ argue that the checkout operation is
non-monotonic, because it requires aggregating over all previous operations
applied to the cart. Non-monotonic operations are potentially expensive because
they might require coordination to produce consistent results.

In this section, we use \lang to make two improvements to the cart
system. First, we improve the ``destructive'' design by using lattices to make
updates to the key-value store monotonic. Second, we show that lattices can be
used to make the checkout process monotonic. In both cases, the result is a
reduced need for coordination and more confidence in the eventual
consistency/convergence of the cart system.

\subsection{Monotonic Destructive Cart}

\subsection{Monotonic Checkout}
Alvaro et al.\ argue that processing a checkout request is non-monotonic because
it requires performing an aggregation query over an asynchronously-computed data
set; in general, coordination might be required to ensure that the entire data
set has been received before the checkout request can be processed
correctly. However, note that the client knows exactly which add/remove
operations should be reflected in the result of the checkout; if that
information can be propagated to the cart service, any chosen replica can decide
if it has enough information to process the checkout operation without needing
to coordinate.
