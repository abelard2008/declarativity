In this section, we consider a simple e-commerce system in which clients
interact with a shopping cart service, adding and removing items over the course
of their browsing session (Figure~\ref{fig:cart-system}). Eventually, a client
submits a ``checkout'' operation, at which point the cumulative effect of their
shopping session should be tabulated and returned to the client. In a more
complete system, the result of the checkout operation might be presented to the
client for confirmation or submitted to a payment processor to complete the
e-commerce transaction. This case study is based on the cart system from Alvaro
et al.~\cite{Alvaro2011}, which was in turn inspired by the discussion of
replicated shopping carts in the Dynamo paper~\cite{DeCandia2007}.
