\section{Syntax and Semantics}

\subsection{Background}
Bloom is a domain-specific language (DSL) for distributed
programming~\cite{Alvaro2011,bloom}. In Bloom, program state is represented
using \emph{collections} and computation is expressed using declarative
\emph{rules}. The original Bloom language only provided set-oriented collections
(as in traditional Datalog), and only allowed Datalog-style conjunctive queries
over those collections; in this paper, we describe how we generalized Bloom to
allow arbitrary lattices to be used to store state, and allow any collection of
morphisms between lattices to be used to express computation.

The current prototype implementation (``Bud'') uses Ruby as the host language
for the DSL, but other host languages are planned.
