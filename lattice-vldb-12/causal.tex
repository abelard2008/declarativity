\section{Case Study: Causal Delivery}

A causal delivery protocol ensures that messages are delivered in an order that
is consistent with the ``happens before'' relation between
messages~\cite{Lamport1978}. Providing a causal order over events has been
identified as a useful building block for loosely consistent distributed
applications~\cite{Lloyd2011}.

We used Bloom to implement a well-known algorithm for point-to-point causal
delivery\cite{Schiper1989}.
