\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion}

\lang simplifies the design of loosely consistent distributed systems by
enabling \emph{composability}. Rather than reasoning about the consistency of an
entire application, the programmer can instead ensure that individual lattices
satisfy \emph{local} correctness properties (e.g., commutativity, associativity,
and idempotence). The CALM analysis then verifies that when these modules are
composed to form an application, the complete program satisfies the desired
consistency properties.

Nevertheless, designing a correct lattice can still be difficult. To address
this, we plan to develop tools to give programmers more confidence in the
correctness of lattice implementations. For example, we plan to build a test
data generation framework that can efficiently cover the space of possible
inputs to lattice merge functions. We also plan to explore a restricted DSL for
writing lattice methods, which would make formal verification of correctness an
easier task.

\lang significantly increases the number of distributed protocols that can be
expressed in a monotonic fashion. Nevertheless, we expect that some programs
will remain non-monotonic, or at least contain a mix of monotonic and
non-monotonic modules. We are investigating how non-monotonicity might be
represented within the lattice framework.
