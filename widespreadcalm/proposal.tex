% \section{Summary}
% The difficulty of distributed programming presents critical challenges to the development of robust and scalable systems for Big Data.  Chief among these challenges is the desire to sidestep coordination overheads while guaranteeing acceptable program outcomes.  The CALM theorem provided a breakthrough framework for reasoning about these problems.  The work we propose here, if successful, would extend the CALM theorem well beyond its initial restricted setting, and use it to define a powerful, principled new framework for robust distributed programming that is consistent with common practice.
