This is intended to be a bibliography of documents that are commonly
referenced in PlanetLab documents.  Please add new entries as appropriate,
the following conventions should help keep things somewhat consistent:

1) labels i.e., the string used to identify a document, should be all
lowercase and may include numbers and dashes.

2) PlanetLab design notes should be entered as technical reports and
should be labelled PDN-YY-NNN where YY and NNN represent the year of
publication and document number respectively.

3) the list should be sorted alphabetically by label - this helps
verify whether a document is in the list or not.

4) commonly used or easily misspelt names have author abbreviations of
the form A_FOO, where FOO represents an individual's 'ID' e.g., A_LLP.

5) documents that are published as both PDNs and conference/workshop
proceedings may be listed twice; the PDN entry should carry a 'note'
field indicating where the document was published.

6) titles may be enclosed in braces to prevent LaTeX mangling the
case of initial letters in each word as it thinks best.

7) author lists longer than 4 may be abbreviated using 'and others'.

8) most important of all: no lines longer than 80 characters.
