The purpose of this document is to track the feedback given by the hotnets
community on componentized protocols. 

The public reviews, found at (http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigcomm/HotNets-IV/discussion.html), 
indicate that the idea of componentized protocols would be useful however it remains to
be seen whether the application/demand truly exists. Exploring real applications
may be worth while in alleviating concerns of a 'real' need for componentized
protocols (rather than the more academic 'overlay' argument). Some possible applications
might be Skype, bittorrent, DTN (TIER?), others?.

Hari Balakrishnan was the source of most the feedback I heard at HotNets. His argument
was TCP is good enough for most applications, and HTTP provides a 'good enough' declarative
interface to the transport layer. He would like our future work to include benchmarks
that clearly indicate the benefit of using our systems over TCP and a case be made
that using componentized protocols would not disrupt current technologies. The latter
comment refers to compatibility with NATs and firewalls, which really drills down to
packetization issues. Something not discussed in the HotNets work.
