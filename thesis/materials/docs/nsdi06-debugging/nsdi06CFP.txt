*Overview*
NSDI focuses on the design principles of large-scale networked and
distributed systems. We believe systems as diverse as Internet routing
services, peer-to-peer file sharing, sensor nets, scalable Web services,
and distributed network measurement share a set of common challenges,
and that progress in any of these areas requires a deep understanding of
how researchers are addressing the challenges of large-scale systems in
other contexts. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across
the networking and systems community?including computer networking,
distributed systems, and operating systems?to foster a
cross-disciplinary approach to addressing our common research challenges.

*Topics*
NSDI will provide a high-quality, single-track forum for presenting new
results and discussing ideas that overlap these disciplines. We seek a
broad variety of work that furthers the knowledge and understanding of
the networked systems community as a whole, continues a significant
research dialog, or pushes the architectural boundaries of large-scale
network services. We solicit papers describing original and previously
unpublished research. Specific topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:

    * Scalable techniques for providing high availability and reliability
    * Security and robustness of highly complex systems
    * Novel architectural approaches (e.g., for specific application
      domains)
    * Network measurements, workload, and topology characterization
    * Autonomous and self-configuring network, system, and overlay
      management
    * Network virtualization and resource management
    * Distributed storage, caching, and query optimization
    * Network protocols and algorithms for complex distributed systems
    * Operating system support for scalable network services
    * Application experiences (e.g., in sensor networks, peer-to-peer
      systems, overlay networks, pervasive computing, and content
      distribution)

*What to Submit*
Submissions should be full papers, 12?14 single-spaced 8.5" x 11" pages,
including figures, tables, and references, two-column format, using
10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, with a maximum
text-block of 6.5" wide x 9" deep. Papers will be automatically checked
by the submission system and those which do not meet the requirements on
size and format will be rejected without being reviewed. Submissions
must be "blind," meaning authors must not be identified in the
submissions, either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the
references or acknowledgments). Submissions will be judged on
originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness.

Authors must submit their paper's title and abstract by October 10,
2005, and the corresponding full paper is due by October 17, 2005.
Accepted papers may be shepherded through an editorial review process by
a member of the Program Committee. Based on initial feedback from the
Program Committee, authors of shepherded papers will submit an editorial
revision of their paper to their Program Committee shepherd by March 13,
2006. The shepherd will review the paper and give the author additional
comments. All authors (shepherded or not) will produce a final
camera-ready paper and the equivalent HTML by March 29, 2006, for the
conference Proceedings.

One author per paper will receive a registration discount of $200.
USENIX will offer a complimentary registration upon request.

The NSDI conference, like most conferences and journals, does not allow
submissions that are substantially similar to works that have previously
been published or are under review for publication elsewhere. Accepted
material may not be subsequently published in other conferences or
journals for one year from the date of acceptance by USENIX. Papers
accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be read or
reviewed. All submissions will be held in confidence prior to
publication of the technical program, both as a matter of policy and in
accordance with the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976.

*How to Submit*
Authors are required to submit at least a title and abstract by October
10, 2005, with the full papers due by October 17, 2005. All submissions
to NSDI '06 must be electronic, in PDF or PostScript, via a Web form
which will be available here.

Authors will be notified of receipt of submission via email. If you do
not receive notification, contact the Program Chairs at
nsdi06chairs@usenix.org <mailto:nsdi06chairs@usenix.org>.

*Best Paper Awards*
Awards will be given for the best paper and best paper for which a
student is the lead author.

*Poster Sessions*
Do you have interesting work in progress you would like to share? Poster
sessions are for you! Poster sessions introduce new or ongoing work, and
the NSDI audience provides valuable discussion and feedback. We are
particularly interested in presentations of student work. To submit a
poster, please send a proposal, one page or less, by March 29, 2006, to
nsdi06posters@usenix.org <mailto:nsdi06posters@usenix.org>. We will send
back decisions by April 17, 2006.

*Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions*
Birds-of-a-Feather sessions (BoFs) are informal gatherings organized by
attendees interested in a particular topic. BoFs will be held in the
evening. BoFs may be scheduled in advance by emailing the USENIX
Conference Department at bofs@usenix.org <mailto:bofs@usenix.org>. BoFs
may also be scheduled at the conference.

*Registration Materials*
Complete program and registration information will be available in
February 2006 on the conference Web site <../>. The information will be
in both HTML and a printable PDF file. If you would like to receive the
latest USENIX conference information, please join our mailing list
<http://www.usenix.org/cgi-bin/mailing/list.cgi>.
