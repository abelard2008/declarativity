Proposal feedback (Nov 10'06)
1. Explore the space of applications where BI-BFT is useful.
2. How does the combination of BI-BFT and HQ would work?
3. Wrap up the theory part.
4. Complete microbenchmarks.
5. Build a real application. Have to use an application where BI-BFT shows
clear improvement over existing approaches.
6. Compare BI-BFT with HQ. In what settings BI-BFT works better?


1) feedback on hotdep draft (July 17th'06)

- Alternative inconsistency metrics (see how they can fit the TACT model?)
  e.g., session guarantees for file system, 

- precise related work

- we are not scaling the original BFT, rather providing a technique
for playing around with consistency and throughput

- clarify key contributions

- what is the relationship between different algorithms? how well
do they cover the design space? is one algo refinement of another?

- library, API?

- for different applications, find what range of error is useful, i.e.,
how does performance related to inconsistency domain?
