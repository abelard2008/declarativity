\item Petros: PKI to MAC Transformations:- By doing some
generic *protocol* transformations (not just small changes in the
contents of messages) we can get the same thing regardless of whether
you use signatures or MACs. Somewhere in there we must talk about whom
we trust to do what (e.g., out of F+1 statements from distinct people at
least one is correct to its knowledge or out of 2F+1 statements at least
one is correct and up-to-date, etc.).
