\section{Conclusion}



Datalog has inspired a variety of recent applied work, which touts the benefits of declarative specifications for practical implementations.  
We have developed substantial experience building significant
distributed systems~\cite{boom-eurosys,Alvaro2009I-Do-Declare:-C,Chu:2007,Loo2009-CACM} using hybrid
declarative/imperative languages such as Overlog~\cite{Loo2009-CACM}.
While our experience with those languages was largely positive, the 
combination of Datalog and imperative constructs 
often clouded  our understanding of the
``correct'' execution of single-node programs that performed state
updates.  
This work developed in large part as a reaction to the semantic difficulties
presented by these distributed logic languages.  

Through its reification of time as data, \lang allowed us to 
achieve the goal of a declarative language without sacrificing critically expressive features for the distributed systems domain.
We believe that \lang is as expressive as Overlog, but formalizing this intuition is difficult because the semantics of Overlog are not well specified.  Instead, we are currently validating our practicality by ``porting'' many of our Overlog programs to \lang.



In \lang, state update and communication differ from logical
deductions only in terms of timing.
In the local case, this allows us to express state update without giving up the clean semantics of Datalog; unlike
Datalog extensions that use imperative constructs to provide such
functionality, each \lang rule expresses a logical invariant that will
hold over all program executions.  
However, interactions with external processes, and primitives such as
asynchronous and unreliable communication introduce nondeterminism
which \lang models with \dedalus{choose}.  
Our hope is that modeling external processes and events with a single
primitive will simplify formal program verification techniques for the distributed systems domain.  Two natural directions in this vein are to determine for a given \lang program whether Church-Rosser confluence holds for all models produced by \dedalus{choice}, or to capture finer-grained notions like serializability of such models with respect to transaction identifiers embedded in EDB facts.
