\section{Dedalus}

By reifying time as data in Dedalus, we can naturally express several important
language concepts, such as persistence, key constraints, and atomicity.
%Persistence is existence over time, key constraints are unique existence over
%time, atomicity is multiple deductions occuring at the same time.

Perhaps more importantly, 
%the infinite sequence of abstract
time gives us a way to reason about ordering, which is particularly difficult
in a set-oriented language like Datalog.  For example, the ordering over any
program inputs (e.g. message queues) can be represented as a mapping between
the ordering domain of the input and the time relation.

We consider a countably infinite Herbrand universe of constants \emph{C}, in
which $C_{1}, C_{2}, [...], C_{n}$ are representations of individual constants,
and a countably infinite universe of variable symbols \emph{A} which may take
on the values of any constants.  \wrm{is this somehow different from regular
Datalog?} 
%
We represent time in Dedalus by the union of set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$, with
a special element $\infty$ that represents ``never''.  We consider the standard
strict total order $<$, with the additional rule that $\forall i \in
\mathbb{Z}: i < \infty$.  We call this order \dedalus{successor}.

\subsection{Syntax}

A Dedalus program is a Datalog program in which every predicate is annotated with a time suffix.  A Dedalus predicate has the following form:

$p(A_{1}, A_{2}, [...], A_{n})@S$

The predicate p() is a truth-valued function over its arguments $A_{1} - A_{n}$, which may be of any type, and S, which is an integer expression 
referring to the logical clock time at which the predicate holds, taking one of the following four suffix forms:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $N$
\item $N + 1$
\item $r(N, A_{1}, A_{2}, [...], A_{n})$
\item an integer
\end{enumerate}

The subset of body variables that appear in the head atom, as well as the time,
comprise the arguments to $r$.  Facts and rules in Dedalus are 
defined just as in Datalog, with the additional restrictions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Every body predicate may only have the suffix $N$.
\item A head predicate may have any suffix except a constant integer.
\item A fact must be posited at a constant time.
\end{itemize}

Rules with the head suffix $N$ are called \emph{deductive} or atemporal rules,
and describe all the logical consequences of facts in a given timestep.  The
set of deductive rules in a given timestep $T$ may be interpreted as a pure
Datalog program, by ignoring the suffixes, and treating all facts that are true
at $T$ as the Datalog EDB.

Rules with the head suffix $N + 1$ are called \emph{inductive} temporal rules,
and describe invariants across a timestep (the relationship between facts in
the current timestep and their consequences in the immediate next timestep).
Inductive rules allow us to atomically capture change in time, and to model
persistent state.

Rules with the head suffix $r(\_)$ are also temporal rules, but unlike
inductive rules, they carry no guarantee as to in which timestep their
consequences will be visible~\footnote{In fact, a fact derived in such a rule
may be visible at a timestep previous to its antecedents.} Such rules, called
{\em message rules}, allow us to model the delay associated with network
messages between nodes: the nodes are likely to have different clock values,
and messages may be lost or delayed arbitrarily in transit.


\subsubsection{Events}

Previous distributed variants of Datalog introduced {\em events}, intuitively
facts that are instantaneously true.  Because these languages have no explicit
language-level notion of time, reasoning about events requires a programmer to
think operationally in terms of the evaluation of the language.  In Dedalus,
an event corresponds to a Datalog fact.  It is a bodyless head clause with all 
constant terms in the form


$p(C_{1},C_{2},[...],C_{n})@I;$


where the elements of C are constants of any type and I is an integer constant.

Events provide ground for any logical inferences given by the deductive rules of the program, and may provide ground for inferences at 
future time steps via inductive rules.

\subsubsection{Persistence}

Events are only true at a single timestep.  It might seem that we could express a persistent predicate as a Datalog fact with a free variable 
for the time suffix.  The tuple would then be universally quantified over time:

\begin{Dedalus}
p(a, b)@N;
\end{Dedalus}

But clearly, because this must be interpreted as a rule head with an unbound variable, it produces an unsafe rule.  Instead, persistence is
expressed by an inductive rule that projects a tuple into the next timestep:

\begin{Dedalus}
p(a, b)@N+1 \(\leftarrow\)
  p(a, b)@N, 
  \(\lnot\) del\_p(a, b)@N;
\end{Dedalus}

This rule, in turn, may be viewed as informally equivalent to a rule in which the inductive step is driven by an 
explicit successor relation, and in which the time suffixes are attributes of their respective predicates:

\begin{Dedalus}
p(a, b, S) \(\leftarrow\)
  p(a, b, N),
  successor(N, S), 
  \(\lnot\) del\_p(a, b, N);
\end{Dedalus}

The final negated subgoal \emph{del\_p} allows us to model overwriteable storage: without it, a tuple will be trivially true at every future timestep if it becomes true
at any timestep.  Instead, the \emph{del\_p} event, true only at a single timestep, breaks the induction.

Consider the following {\em trace} of events:

\begin{Dedalus}
p(1,2)@101;
p(1,3)@102;
p(1,?)@200;
del_p(1,2)@300;
p(1,?)@301;
\end{Dedalus}

It is easy to see that the results of the two queries are:


\begin{Dedalus}
p(1,2)@200;
p(1,3)@200;
p(1,3)@301;
\end{Dedalus}

\subsubsection{Traces}

\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
A \emph{trace} is a set of events.
\end{definition}

In the trace above, we omitted as uninteresting those events that were implied by the 
inductive rules show above, such as:

\begin{Dedalus}
p(1,2)@200;
p(1,3)@200;
p(1,2)@201;
p(1,3)@201;
p(1,2)@202;
p(1,3)@202;
[...]
\end{Dedalus}



\begin{definition}
A \emph{minimal trace} is a subset of a trace that excludes any events caused by inductive rules.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{reduced trace} is a projection of a minimal trace in which all event times are transformed
to a normal form in which the trace starts with event time 1, respects the ordering of the original trace, as leaves no gaps in the sequence.
\end{definition}

A finite trace has only one reduced trace, but an infinite number of infinite traces have the same reduced trace: the reduced trace thus forms an 
equivalence class among traces.  Not all reduced traces are finite.  The reduced trace of the trace instance given above is:

\begin{Dedalus}
p(1,2)@1;
p(1,3)@2;
p(1,?)@3;
del_p(1,2)@4;
p(1,?)5;
\end{Dedalus}


\paa{notes:}

Some other things that we may want to say about traces (although probably not here) are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a reduced trace represents a \emph{disentanglement} of a series of events and the local clock that existed in the original trace.
\item we'd expect minimal traces of asynchronous systems to be fairly simple, and we'd expect to frequently find equivalences.
The complexity added by physical clocks -- which are external events like messages -- is illustrated by the complexity of traces including
clock events.  it is easy to show that we \emph{must} include clock events in a trace, because without them explicitly in the input data, two
replays of the trace may have different results.  consider two machines running the trace, one with a slow clock.  it fires a timeout that 
doesn't fire on the other machine, given the same input.
\item if a particular property holds of a given trace, can we say that it holds of its minimal and reduced traces?
\item 

\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{State Change}

In Dedalus, a database update is an atomic (due to the adjacent timestamps)
pair of events with a deletion of the old value and assertion of the new, in
the form:

$p(C_{1},C_{2},[...],C_{n})@I+1;$
\\
$del\_p(C_{1},C_{2},[...],C_{n})@I;$

For example:

\begin{Dedalus}
del\_p(1,2)@300; 
p(1, 4)@301;
\end{Dedalus}

More generally, an update can be described by a pair of rules that, in effect,
describe an invariant that holds between values in two adjacent timesteps.
For example, an update to the second column of the predicate \dedalus{p} is
expressed as:

\begin{Dedalus}
p(A, B)@N+1 \(\leftarrow\)
  update_p(A, B)@N;
  p(A, _)@N;
  
del_p(A, C)@N \(\leftarrow\)
  p(A, C)@N,
  update_p(A, _)@N;
  
\end{Dedalus}

\subsubsection{Sequences}

Database sequences, objects that retain and increment a counter value, can be
represented with a pair of inductive rules.  One increments the current counter value when the
trigger event is true, while the other persists the current value of the sequence only when the event is 
not true.

\begin{Dedalus}
seq(Agent, S + 1)@N+1 \(\leftarrow\)
  seq(Agent, S)@N, 
  event(Agent)@N; 
  
seq(Agent, S)@N+1 \(\leftarrow\) 
  seq(Agent, S)@N, 
  \(\lnot\) event(Agent)@N;
\end{Dedalus}

\subsubsection{Queues}
%%any tuple sent via a message rule is not sent to the indicated head p but to the builtin (as del\_p)
%%m\_p.  

\paa{it is here (at the m\_p relation) that is is assigned a timestamp which is consistent with r() at the sender, but which
is really "now" (how do we talk about this, having banished now?)}

Consider a relation that contains input from the external world, e.g. messages or tuple insertions from the host language.  
Having defined persistence as induction over time, we can define \emph{external} inputs as any sources of tuples 
that are not produced by an inductive rule.  This corresponds precisely to the concept of minimal traces that we have already
defined.

It will often be necessary to interpose some queueing discipline between an external table as defined above and any
rules that read from them.  For instance, if the tuples represent non-idempotent commands, it may be necessary to dequeue
the tuples in some data-dependent order, and to run the program to fixpoint before considering new tuples.  Consider a binary
predicate \emph{balance\_update} that contains updates to a bank account and an integer indicating the order in which they
should be executed.  If deductive rules are directly associated with \emph{balance\_update}, we must ensure at minimum that
the rules cleanly handle cases is which multiple events occur in a single fixpoint.  Instead, we can ensure ordered delivery 
of tuples to a program via a subprogram that defines a queueing discipline.

In the program below, we define a table \emph{m\_p} that we use as a queue to feed \emph{p}.  The queue must persist across
timesteps because it may take an unknown number of timesteps to drain it.  At each fixpoint, for each value of \textbf{A}, a single
tuple is projected into \emph{p} and atomically deleted from \emph{m\_p}, changing the value of the aggregate calculated at the
subsequent step:


\begin{Dedalus}
m\_p(A, B)@N+1 \(\leftarrow\)
  m\_p(A, B)@N,
  notin del\_m\_p(A, B)@N;

omin(A, min<B>)@N \(\leftarrow\)
  m\_p(A, B)@N;

p(A, B)@N+1 \(\leftarrow\)
  m\_p(A, B)@N,
  omin(A, B)@N;

del\_m\_p(A, B)@N \(\leftarrow\)
  m\_p(A, B)@N,
  omin(A, B)@N;
\end{Dedalus}

Under such a discipline, deductive rules that are predicated on \emph{p} are constrained to consider only one tuple per fixpoint
per value of the variable \textbf{A}.  For example, if \textbf{A} contains the source address of a message and \textbf{B} is the ordering
domain of messages for a given host, this code fragment
expresses a per-host FIFO discipline.  To enforce a global FIFO ordering over \emph{p}, we may redefine \emph{omin} and any 
dependent rules to exclude the \textbf{A} atttribute.

As this example demonstrates, queues are not a language feature or a detail of the runtime system, but are themselves Dedalus programs
characterized by programmatic interaction with time.


\paa{there is still an operational element here: the assignment of the timestamps as tuples are inserted.  this is basically the 
evaluation of the r() function.}

\subsubsection{Lamport Clocks}

Implementing a Lamport Clock~\cite{timeclocks} is a special case of a queueing discipline as defined above.
Consider a predicate{m\_p} as defined above, but with an extra integer attribute that contains the logical transmission
time of the sender (via a message rule) of a given tuple.  For example, the sender's rule will look like: 

\begin{Dedalus}
m\_p(A, B, N)@r(A, B, N) \(\leftarrow\)
  send\_p(A, B)@N;
\end{Dedalus}

Note that the time suffix is projected into the last attribute of \emph{m\_p}.  This establishes an \emph{entanglement} between
the sender's local clock and the program dataflow.  The queueing discipline that implements a
Lamport clock is then:

\begin{Dedalus}

m\_p(A, B, C)@N+1 \(\leftarrow\)
  m\_p(A, B, C)@N,
  \(\lnot\) del\_m\_p(A, B, C)@N;

omin(A, min<C>)@N \(\leftarrow\)
  m\_p(A, B, C)@N;

lmin(min<C>)@N \(\leftarrow\)
  m\_p(_, _, C);

p(A, B, C)@N+1 :-
  m\_p(A, B, C)@N,
  omin(B)@N,
  lmax(L)@N,
  N > L;

del\_m\_p(A, B)@N :-
  m\_p(A, B)@N,
  omax(B)@N;
  
\end{Dedalus}
