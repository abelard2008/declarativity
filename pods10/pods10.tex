\begin{abstract} 
%
Recent programming language research has explored the use of Datalog-based
languages for expressing a distributed system as a set of logical
invariants~\cite{loo-sigmod06,boom-techr}.  Two properties of distributed
systems proved hard to model in Datalog.  First, the state of any such system
evolves with its execution.  Second, deductions in these systems may be
arbitrarily delayed, dropped, or re-ordered by the unreliable network links
they must traverse.  Previous efforts addressed the former by extending the
Datalog model to admit updates, key constraints, persistence and events, and
the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay.
These details have a semantics outside Datalog, increasing the complexity of
the language or its interpretation respectively, and forcing programmers to
think operationally.  We argue that the missing component from these previous
languages is a notion of {\em time}.  In this paper we present {\bf \lang}, a
foundation language for programming and reasoning about distributed systems.
\lang is a syntactic subset of Datalog~\cite{ullmanbook} with negation,
aggregate functions and choice, and admits an explicit representation of time
into the logic language.  Thus, \lang allows concepts like persistence,
updateable state, key constraints, and message delay and loss to be described
in a purely declarative fashion.  This allows us to express distributed systems
whose state evolves over time in a high-level language with an unambiguous,
model-theoretic semantics.
%Dedalus extends Datalog with a notion of time --- every Dedalus relation has
%an integer attribute that intuitively represents when a given tuple is true.
%We propose a sugared syntax in which rule head annotations indicate whether
%their conclusions hold at the same time as their premises, in the immediate
%next timestep, or at some unknown timestep.
We further introduce the notion of \emph{temporal stratification}, a
syntactically-checkable property of \lang programs similar to stratification,
and show that the class of temporally stratifiable programs in \lang
corresponds to the class of modularly stratified~\cite{modular,ross-syntactic}
programs in Datalog.
