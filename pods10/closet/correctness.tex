\section{Correctness properties}

\subsection{Safety}

we need merely to show the base case, in which an invariant is established (in fact, this should \emph{always} be a valid 
initial state, or the safety property isn't guaranteed to always hold), the existence of an inductive rule that ensures that every 
subsequent step maintains the invariant, and the absence of any rule that can break the induction by deducing a del\_* rule.

\subsection{Liveness}

We cannot state a liveness property as an assertion, because doing so would involve quantifying over time,
and time is an infinite sequence.  Instead, we must prove liveness properties, expressed as temporal logic
formulae, given the rules of the program and any given safety properties as axioms.

In many cases it will be possible to show that attempts to achieve liveness properties will occur infinitely often, and that
these attempts have a nonzero probability of success.  We'd like to do better than this and provide realistic guarantees...
