\subsection{Stratification in {\large{\bf\slang}}}

We now turn our attention to another traditional Datalog concern: semantics of
programs with negation.  As we will see, the inclusion of time introduces a
``source of monotonicity'' in programs that allows for clean minimal model
semantics in some surprising cases, and enables purely syntactic monotonicity
checks for a broad class of temporal programs.

%%\paa{notes}

%%this section has become cluttered, but for me the main results are the following:

%%\begin{enumerate}
%%\item Negation-, aggregation- and choice-free \lang programs have a unique minimal model (pure Datalog)
%%\item stratifiable \lang programs have a unique minimal model (again, Datalog, but we need to show that the restrictions and syntactic transformations
%%cannot introduce a cycle or add a negative edge to an existing cycle.)
%%\item \emph{temporally stratified} \lang programs (w/o choice) force any cycles with negation to involve an inductive edge, forcing an ordering on the evaluation.
%%we can show that in all such cases, the corresponding datalog program is modularly stratified (insofar as \emph{successor} is considered to be ``completely
%%evaluated" in a lower module.)  since modularly stratified programs have a unique stable model, so do any temporally stratified \lang programs.
%%\end{enumerate}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:no-neg-unique}
%
A \slang program without negation 
%%and aggregation 
has a unique minimal model.
%
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} 
%
A \slang program without negation 
%%and aggregation 
is a pure Datalog
program.  Every pure Datalog program has a unique minimal model. 
%
\end{proof}

%%\jmh{Oops, you forgot that this model is countably infinite due to infinite time. So I could add countably many random consistent facts and have an equally ``small'' model. You will need a more refined definition of safety and minimality that accounts for time.}

%%\jmh{I'm going to stop commenting here since you'll need some more machinery to continue.}

We define syntactic stratification of a \slang program the same way it is
defined for a Datalog program:

\begin{definition}
%
A \slang program is \emph{syntactically stratifiable} if there
exists no cycle with a negative edge 
%%or an aggregation edge 
in the program's
predicate dependency graph.
%
\end{definition}

%%We evaluate such a program by evaluating each strongly connected component of
%%its predicate dependency graph under a closed-world assumption.  

We may evaluate such a program in {\em stratum order} as described in the
Datalog literature. \wrm{cite?}
%any order returned by a topological sort on the predicate dependency graph,
%with each strongly connected component collapsed to a single node.

It is easy to see that any syntactically stratified \slang instance has a
unique minimal model because it is a syntactically stratified Datalog program.

%\begin{lemma}
%
%A syntactically stratifiable \lang instance without choice has a unique
%minimal model.  That is, there exists a function $D$ from syntactically
%stratifiable \lang instances without choice to their minimal models.
%
%\end{lemma}

%\begin{proof}
%\wrm{todo: insert statement that this is obvious}
%
%We know that there exists a function $B$ from syntactically stratifiable
%Datalog instances to their minimal models \wrm{cite?}.  Earlier, we introduced
%\wrm{XXX: where?} a bijection \wrm{XXX: probably not a bijection} $A$ from the
%set of \lang instances without choice to the set of Datalog instances, and a
%bijection $C$ between minimal models of Datalog instances and minimal models of
%\lang instances without choice.  We will show that $D = C \circ B \circ A$.

%Thus, we need only prove that the restriction of $A$ to syntactically
%stratifiable \lang instances without choice maps to a subset of syntactically
%stratifiable Datalog instances.  But this is clear, as $A$ does not add any
%rules to the instance, and may introduce only the non-negated EDB {\em
%successor} relation to the body of an existing rule.  Thus, $A$ cannot
%introduce any new cycle or add negation to any existing cycle in the instance's
%predicate dependency graph.
%
%\end{proof}

However, many programs we are interested in expressing are not syntactically
stratifiable.  Fortunately, we are able to define a syntactically checkable
notion of {\em temporal stratifiability} of \slang programs that maps to a
subset of {\em modularly stratifiable}~\cite{modular} Datalog programs.

%Intuitively, a Datalog instance is modularly stratifiable if no EDB
%element depends negatively on itself.

%%\begin{example}
%%Consider a predicate \emph{print} that corresponds to a print queue.  The program below
%%states that if there is a message \{A, B\}, then there 
%%\begin{Dedalus}
%%print(A, B) \(\leftarrow\)
%%  message(A, B),
%%  \(\lnot\)print(A, B);
%%\end{Dedalus}
%%\end{example}

%Peter said we might not need these formal definitions.  Experimenting without
%\begin{definition}
%
%A Datalog program and EDB is \emph{locally stratifiable} if, after
%instantiating the rules given the Herbrand saturation of the program and EDB,
%there exists no cycle with a negation or aggregation edge in the dependency
%graph of instantiated ground atoms.
%
%\end{definition}

%We take the definition below from Ross~\cite{modular, ross-syntactic}.
%\begin{definition}
%
%A Datalog instance is \emph{modularly stratifiable} if, and only if its
%mutally recursive components are locally stratified once all instantiated rules
%with a false subgoal that is defined in a ``lower" component are removed.
%\end{definition}

%\begin{lemma}
%
%A locally stratifiable \lang instance without choice has a unique
%minimal model.  That is, there exists a function $E$ from locally
%stratifiable \lang instances without choice to their minimal models.
%
%\end{lemma}

%\begin{proof}
%
%\wrm{TODO}

\begin{definition} 
%
A \slang program is \emph{temporally stratifiable} if its deductive
reduction is syntactically stratifiable.
%
\end{definition}

%%\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:temp-strat-uniq}
%
Any temporally stratifiable \slang instance $P$ has a unique minimal model.
%
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proof}
%
{\bf Case 1:} $P$ consists of only deductive rules.  In this case, $P$'s
deductive reduction is $P$ itself.  We know $P$ is syntactically stratifiable,
thus it has a unique minimal model.

{\bf Case 2:} $P$ consists of both deductive and inductive rules.  Assume that
$P$ does not have a unique minimal model.  This implies that $P$ is not
syntactically stratifiable.  Thus, there must exist some cycle through at least
one predicate $q$ involving negation.
%%or aggregation.  
Furthermore, this cycle must involve an inductive rule, as $P$ is temporally
stratified.

Since the time suffix in the head of an inductive rule is strictly greater than
the time suffix of its body, no atom may depend negatively on itself -- it may
only depend negatively on atoms in the previous timestep.  Thus, $P'$ is
modularly stratified over time, using the definition of modular stratification
according to Ross \etal~\cite{modular}.  This guarantees a unique minimal model
achievable via standard bottom-up fixpoint execution.
%
%does not have a unique minimal model.  This implies that $P$ is not
%syntactically stratifiable, thus there must exist some cycle through at least
%one predicate $q$ involving a negation or aggregation edge in $P$'s predicate
%dependency graph, and furthermore this cycle must include at least one
%inductive rule.  Since an inductive rule has a time suffix $S := N+1$, where
%$N$ is the timestamp of its body, and $P$'s deductive reduction is
%syntactically stratifiable, we know that the aggregate or negation of $q$ must
%always occur in a strictly earlier or later timestamp than that of the
%positive $q$ atom.  Since the timestep in the cycle increases monotonically
%with each iteration, $q$ will never, in practice, depend on a negation or
%aggregate of itself.  Thus, $P$ is locally stratifiable, and by Lemma XXX
%above, $P$ has a unique minimal model.  This contradicts our assumption that
%$P$ does not have a unique minimal model.  Thus, $P$ has a unique minimal
%model.
%
\end{proof}


\begin{example}
A simple temporally stratifiable \slang program that is not syntactically stratifiable.

\begin{Dedalus}
persist[p, 3]  
  
r1
p(A, B, T) \(\leftarrow\)
  insert\_p(A, B, T);

r2  
p_neg(A, B, T) \(\leftarrow\)
  p(A, B, T),
  delete\_p(T);
\end{Dedalus}

In the \slang program above, \emph{insert\_p} and \emph{delete\_p} are captured
in EDB relations.  This reasonable program is unstratifiable because $p \succ
p\nega \land p\nega \succ p$.  But because the successor relation is
constrained such that $\forall A,B, successor(A, B) \rightarrow B > A$, any
such program is modularly stratified on \emph{successor}.  Therefore, we have
$p_{n} \not\succ^* del\_p_{n} \not\succ^* p_{n+1}$; informally, earlier values
do not depend on later values.
