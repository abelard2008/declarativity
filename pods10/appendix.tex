A table in Overlog can be described by the tuple

$T(n, A, K)$

where $n$ is the table name, $A$ is an ordered list of attribute types, and $K$ is a set of indices into $A$, which together defined the primary key of the relation.
If $K \neq \emptyset$, then the table is \emph{materialized}.

\subsection{Rewrite Algorithm}

Given an Overlog program P and a set of table definitions, each given as $T(n, A, K)$, output a doughface program P' containing all the statements in the numbered lines below:

\begin{Dedalus} \small
For every predicate n in P with table definition {n, A, K}
  1.) ri_n@N :- e_n@N
  if K is nonempty, divide the indices of A into two 
  disjoint sets X and Y s.t. 
    \(X = alphabet(K)\)
    \(Z = alphabet(indices(A))\)
    \(Y = Z - X\)
      (where alphabet() is a function mapping a list of 
      integers to a list of uppercase letters.)
    1a.) \(i_n(Z)@N \leftarrow ri_n(Z)@N, choose((X), (Y));\)
    2a.) \(pk_n(X)@N :- \leftarrow_n(Z)@N;\)
    3a.) \(i_n(Z)@N \leftarrow co_n@N, \lnot pk_n@N;\)
    4a.) \(co_n@N+1 \leftarrow i_n@N, \lnot del_n@N;\)
  otherwise
    1b.) \(i_n@N \leftarrow co_n@N;\)
    2b.) \(i_n@N \leftarrow ri_n@N;\)
  2.)  Perform the consistent IDB rewrite on P:
    - for all predicates that are mutually recursive with \(n\), 
      replace all occurrences of \(p\) with \(ri_n\);
    - for all predicates stratified above n, replace all 
      occurrences of n with \(i\_n\).
 
\end{Dedalus}

The algorithm above takes the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item (1) Ensure that all events are projected into the inflationary IDB.
\item (1a) After completing evaluation on the stratum for $ri\_n$, choose a subset (only proper if there are key violations) S of $ri\_n$ such that
each assignment of values to the key attributes X only occurs once in S
the values of the non-key attributes Y are functionally dependent on X
\item (2a) Project out the key columns.
\item (3a) Project any facts induced from the previous timestep into the consistent IDB $i\_n$ for the current timestep, provided their key columns X do not appear in the key projection $pk\_n$.
\item (4a) Induce into the next timestep any consistent IDB tuples from the current timestep, provided we have not deduced their deletion in this timestep.
\end{itemize}

This rewrite ensures that the semantics associated with materialization and key constraint maintenance in the Overlog program are precisely mimicked in the doughface translation. In particular, this means that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If there are any keys defined on the table, tuples persist, once inserted, until they are deleted. This is captured by (3a).
\item In the event of a key conflict,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If a tuple carried over from a previous timestep conflicts with a new tuple, the old one is not included in the new consistent IDB (3a).
	\item If there are multiple conflicting new tuples, one of them is chosen arbitrarily (1a).
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
