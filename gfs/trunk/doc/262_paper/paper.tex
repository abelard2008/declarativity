\section{Introduction}

\section{The BOOM Vision}
Motivating the use of declarative logic languages for implementing
distributed systems.

Approach 1:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  building distributed systems is hard

\item
  current techniques for building distributed systems are
  ineffective. Why? Because they operate at the wrong level of
  abstraction

\item
  Declarative logic languages allow the programmer to work at a more
  comfortable level of abstraction
\end{itemize}

Approach 2:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Like distributed systems, networking protocols are traditionally
  described as finite state machines.

\item 
  Somewhat surprisingly, the declarative specification of network
  protocols yields promising results.

\item 
  We plan to apply the same techniques to a broader class of
  distributed systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Declarative Specification of Distributed Filesystems}
Why choose GFS to implement in a declarative language?
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Separation of control and data paths in the design.

\item
  Data centric, ``systemsy''

\item
  Existing implementations intermingle policy and mechanism
\end{itemize}

\section{System Architecture}

\section{System Realization}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Language integration: what belongs in declarative land, and what in
  imperative land?

\item
  Representation of data

\item
  Use of Paxos as a component
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Evaluation}
Compared with HDFS. Look at both overall throughput, and metadata ops/second.

\section{Related Work}

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Challenges/difficulties

\item
  Some of the Lincoln vision?

\item
  Cross-layer optimizations

\item
  Continuous query optimization

\item
  Hadoop integration
\end{itemize}
