\section{Introduction}
Logic languages have promise... blah blah
People have tried before to model async distributed systems with logic... blah blah... attempts were ad-hoc
Identify salient issue that separates an asynchronous distributed system from a centralized system: things may be non-atomic, and things may be out-of-order
Attractive formalization of representation of distributed systems in logic unifies these two salient issues into a notion of ``time''
This formalism helps us gain new insight into the correctness of distributed systems; specifically:
We explore two correctness criteria for distributed systems:
(1) the system is deterministic (confluent)
(2) any execution of the system preserves eventual consistency
We identify the model theoretic notions that guarantee these results, and provide (and prove) a spectrum of conservative tests that can aid the programmer in crafting a distributed system that meets these criteria
