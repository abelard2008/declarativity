\section{Introduction}
\nrc{Another possible approach to the first para: observe that declarative logic langs are seeing increased use in a wide variety of domains, from games to modular robotics, because of succinctness, formal analysis, etc. Then argue that distributed systems are a particularly promising domain for declarative logic.}
Distributed logic languages \wrm{cite stuff here, to make it clear that what we mean by a ``distributed logic language'' are the following instances of prior work} promise to significantly raise the level of
abstraction at which distributed systems are currently implemented.
Commonly, this class of languages allow
programmers to specify systems as a set of invariants over local state,
%%\wrm{okay, maybe say ``commonly'' or ``one popular design choice'' or something before %%``these languages allow programs to specify systems as invariants over local state and rules 
%%that describe how state changes and moves across a network,'' because i think we all would 
%%consider something to be a distributed logic language that defines invariants over global or 
%%remote state}
%% \wrm{local isn't important, it's just a design choice of dedalus}
and rules that describe how state changes and moves across a network. 
%%\wrm{again this detail isn't important, it's just a design choice of dedalus}.  
This approach leads to succinct, executable specifications whose faithfulness to the original pseudocode may be visually verified.
\nrc{Which ``original pseudocode'' are you referring to? Seems like a much crisper pitch for distributed logic langs should be possible.}\rcs{This would be a good place to say that we're a bridge between easily-verifiable languages like TLA, and efficiently executable languages like datalog}
\paa{fair enough, hack away}
Moreover, many 
distributed logic languages are extensions of first-order logic enhanced with
a {\em least fixpoint operator}, which lends itself to powerful
formal verification techniques~\cite{wang, wang2}.

We conjecture that logic languages are a better fit for the specification of concurrent and distributed systems than traditional imperative approaches.  In imperative languages, whose instructions are built up from applications of a sequencing primitive and whose state is commonly stored in data structures like lists and trees, ordering is implicit and ubiquitous, 
while concurrency is achieved by duplicating the sequential control structures (i.e., stacks)
or by partitioning computation across CPUs,
and allowing the programs to run in an interleaved or truly concurrent fashion, respectively.
%%\nrc{I don't follow what ``duplicating the sequential control structures'' means.}\rcs{Two 
%%options: something about duplicating the stack, or ``... by explicitly partitioning computation 
%%across CPUs, and allowing them to ...''}
%\wrm{what about concurrent data structures?  maybe we cut the ``concurrency is achieved...'' 
%and replace it with ``the programmer must take specific steps to achieve concurrency''}.   
%whoops -- thought you said "data structures" instead of "control structures"
In contrast, declarative language constructs, built up from the implication primitive and abstracting program state into relations, are in general order-independent, forcing the programmer to explicitly reason about ordering of data elements or operations,
\nrc{This seems a confusing claim: the programmer must also ``reason about ordering of data elements and operations'' in an imperative language}
but in return allowing a high degree of concurrency and often ``embarrassing'' 
parallelism~\cite{podskey}. 
\nrc{People usually speak of ``embarrassing parallelism'' as a property of a particular problem/algorithm, not a language.} 
Instead of reasoning about the possible interleavings of sequential
instructions or the serial order of message arrival as one must when writing threaded or 
event-driven code, respectively, a distributed logic language allows the programmer to focus
on the admissible, atomic transformations over state that can in general be carried out in
parallel.  This inversion of concerns -- implicit concurrency and explicit order, instead of
implicit order and explicit concurrency -- can both ease the programmer's cognitive burden as
concurrency and parallelism increase, and help to highlight the few (but critical) 
portions of a distributed algorithm for which order is essential to correctness.

\paa{briefly deal with the shortcomings of previous logic languages.  text from
outline: ``they get squirrelly when you introduce events, which you NEED to do so to implement constructs that express mutable state (eg state machines, update) or preserve or reestablish order in the face of asynchrony (eg sequences, queues).  dedalus admits such ordered constructs (via reification of time) without sacrificing powerful static analysis capabilities -- in fact, it admits new analysis that are unique to the asynchronous domain''}

In order to support mutable state (for example, to express state transitions) and 
sequencing constructs (to restore the order lost by asynchronous communication),
many previous distributed logic languages introduced a small set of operational
features that are familiar in the domain, such as events, counters or sequences, 
and implicit queues.  
These operational aspects often lead to semantic ambiguitities when combined
with the underlying declarative constructs: while the resulting languages {\em looked}
like Datalog, it was usually not possible to leverage the rich set of static analyses 
available in a ``pure'' logic language.


In this paper we reconsider declarative programming for distributed
systems from a model-theoretic perspective. We introduce a declarative
language called \lang
\begin{comment}
\footnote{\small \lang is intended as a precursor
  language for \textbf{Bloom}, a high-level language for programming
  distributed systems that will replace Overlog in the \textbf{BOOM}
  project~\cite{boom-eurosys}.  As such, it is derived from the
  character Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce's \emph{Ulysses}, whose
  dense and precise chapters precede those of the novel's hero,
  Leopold Bloom.  The character Dedalus, in turn, was partly derived
  from Daedalus, the greatest of the Greek engineers and father of
  Icarus.  Unlike Overlog, which flew too close to the sun, Dedalus
  remains firmly grounded.  }

that enables the specification of rich
distributed systems concepts without recourse to operational
constructs.
\wrm{assignment of timestamps is operational.  i think the point we want to make is that we elegantly minimize the operational semantics}
\lang is a subset of
Datalog, enhanced with negation, aggregate functions, choice,
and a successor relation.  
%%\wrm{its not well studied, that's why we're studying it in this paper} 
\lang provides a model-theoretic 
%%\rcs{what does this mean?  Are we just dropping buzzwords here?} 
foundation
for the two key features of distributed systems: mutable state and
asynchronous processing and communication.  We show how these features
are captured in \lang using logical time. 

\paa{three features: default unordered, order analysis and flex, reconfigurability}.
\lang makes three principal contributions to the implementation and analysis
of distributed systems.  First, like other logic languages, it presents an
alternative to the traditional sequential programming model,  encouraging
programmers to compose expressions that are order-independent and hence admit
both parallel execution and rewrite-based optimizations.
Second, \lang provides static analyses that can detect where in a distributed system
order constructs may be necessary to overcome indeterminacy caused by arbitrary
communication delay.  \lang is expressive enough to implement a rich set of ordering
constructs, including events, sequences, queues
and distributed clocks,
which may be employed to restore necessary orders to such systems.
Because the explicit inclusion of time allows a purely logical interpretation of 
these constructs, their incorporation in \lang does not force us to sacrifice 
the many powerful analyses from the Datalog literature.
In combination, these features lead to ... \paa{how to sell reconfigurability?}

Throughout, we demonstrate the expressivity
and practical utility of our work with specific examples, including a
number of building-block routines from classical distributed
computing, such as sequences, queues, and distributed clocks.  
%%We also discuss the correspondence between \lang and our
%%prior work implementing full-featured distributed services in somewhat
%%more operational Datalog variants~\cite{boom-eurosys,Loo2009-CACM}.
As a running example, this paper will discuss various approaches to 
implementing and analyzing a distributed ``shopping cart'' application.

\begin{comment}
\paa{ possibly reuse the below in the 1st para as neil suggests (but as ras recommends
against}

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in Datalog as
the foundation for applied, domain-specific languages in a wide
variety of areas, including networking~\cite{Loo2009-CACM},
distributed systems~\cite{Belaramani:2009,Chu:2007}, natural language
processing~\cite{Eisner:2004}, robotics~\cite{Ashley-Rollman:2007},
compiler analysis~\cite{Lam:2005}, security~\cite{sd3,Li:2003,Zhou:2009}
and computer games~\cite{White:2007}.  The resulting languages have
been promoted for their compact and natural representations of tasks
in their respective domains, in many cases leading to code that is
orders of magnitude shorter than equivalent imperative programs.
Another stated advantage of these languages is the ability to
directly capture intuitive specifications of protocols and programs as
executable code.

While most of these efforts were intended to be ``declarative''
languages, many chose to extend Datalog with operational features
natural to their application domain.  These operational aspects,
though familiar, limit the ability of the language designers to
leverage the rich literature on Datalog: program checks like safety
and stratifiability, and optimizations like magic sets and
materialized recursive view maintenance.  In addition, combining
operational and declarative constructs often
leads to semantic ambiguities.  This is of particular interest to us
in the context of networking and other distributed systems, both
because we have considerable practical experience with these
languages~\cite{boom-eurosys,Loo2009-CACM}, and because others have
examined the semantic ambiguities of these languages in some
depth~\cite{Mao2009,navarro}.\rcs{Furthermore, a wide range of network protocols have already been proven correct in higher level logic languages, such as TLA.  Unfortunately, while these languages are ``executable'' in some sense, they include constructs that cannot be automatically mapped into efficient implementations.}


Sometimes order -- ordering of data elements, as well as ordered computational steps -- 
is required by an algorithm, and in a logic language this order must be explicitly specified and 
managed.  Previous languages 

\paa{story: admitting order (that is, time) into logic is tricky, and retaining a purely logical interpretation for how the order is established and respected is downright hard.  as you'll see in the next section, nearly all of the useful idioms for DS construction are problematic/ambiguous precisely because they describe composite operations across timesteps, without the vocabulary to make clear what things co-occur atomically.}

% \wrm{todo: transition that explains Datalog's birth from these languages... I
% don't know enough to write it} The family of logic-based database languages, of
% which Datalog is the progenitor, represent expressive programming languages
% that produce similar dataflow representations.  Datalog is purely deductive: a
% program specifies the rules by which the derived relations are populated based
% on a static database, which is never updated.  Recent programming language
% research has explored the use of Datalog-based languages for expressing
% distributed systems.  Because the state of any complex system evolves with its
% execution, these efforts were forced to extend the Datalog model by admitting
% updates, additions and deletions of the EDB.  Unfortunately, these previous
% attempts were plagued with ambiguities about how and when state changes occur
% and become visible, putting a heavy burden on the programmer to ensure even
% simple properties, such as atomicity of updates over time.
% 
% In contrast to reasoning about state change procdurally, \lang observes
% that this concept is intuitively expressed as invariants over {\em time}.  In
% this work, we present a formal model of Datalog augmented with time extensions.
% By reifying time as data an introducing it into the logic, \lang eliminates
% previous ambiguities, ensures atomicity of updates and makes it possible to
% express system invariants that can guarantee liveness properties, a key
% challenge in building distributed systems.
