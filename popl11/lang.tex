The intuition behind \lang's \dedalus{successor} relation is that it models the
passage of (logical) time.  In our discussion, we will say that ground atoms
with lower time suffixes occur ``before'' atoms with higher ones.

The constraints we imposed on \slang rules restrict how deductions may be made
with respect to time.  First, rules may only refer to a single time suffix variable in
their body, and hence {\em cannot join across different ``timesteps''}.  Practically, this guarantees that a fact at time $T$ can only interact with other facts at the same time.

Second, rules may specify
deductions that occur concurrently with their ground facts or in the next
timestep, or at some unrelated time---in \lang, we rule out induction ``backwards'' in time or
``skipping'' into the future.
