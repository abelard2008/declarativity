\maketitle

\begin{abstract} 
%
Imperative programming languages are {\em ordered} by default, and often
require programmers to explicitly duplicate sequential control structures to
support parallelism.  Unfortunately, much of this order is {\em false order} --
order that is not semantically meaningful to the computation, or obscures
opportunities for parallelism.  We argue for an inversion in design -- parallel
by default, and programmer-defined order only when required for correctness.
To this end, we propose \lang, a {\em logic} language, and study it in the
context of distributed asynchronous systems. \lang is based on the well-studied
Datalog~\cite{ullmanbook} language, which exposes a single operator to the user
-- {\em logical implication}, and a single data structure -- the set.

We observe that broadly, recourse to order is only needed to express two
features of asynchronous systems: {\em mutable state} and deterministic results
in the face of {\em asynchrony}, or non-determinism in temporal order.  To this
end, we build a library of ordered constructs in \lang that encode a variety of
useful ordered structures.  We also extend static analyses from the Datalog
domain, including a surprisingly powerful analysis that can indicate locations
in the program where a programmer may need to enforce order to maintain
determinism in the face of asynchrony.  We illustrate the benefits of our
proposed programming style through a case study of a shopping cart application
with replicated state.

%and require programmers to explicitly specify exclude order to support parallelism.  Well-known prior work has equated various computational complexity classes with logics, implying a correspondence between computation and deduction.  In logic, certain formulas may lead to contradictions, such as $p$ if $\lnot p$.  We observe that adding a notion of {\em order} to such formulas prevents the contradiction, by explicitly excluding coincidence of $p$ and $\lnot p$.  However, a large class of logical statements are non-contradictory even in the absence of order.  We propose a programming paradigm where computation is unordered (embarassingly parallel) by default, and conservative syntactic checks force the imposition of order to avoid contradiction.  

%We observe that broadly, recourse to order is only needed to model two features
%of asynchronous systems: {\em mutable state} and {\em asynchrony}.  As
%asynchrony corresponds to non-determinism in order, this non-determinism may
%influence the results of the computation -- clearly an undesirable result if we
%wish to build asynchronous systems that are eventually deterministic (i mean
%Pete's confluence thing later).  Using \lang, we build many common abstractions
%for distributed systems, such as queues, etc.  We then compose these constructs
%to define programming styles that ensure determinism, and study this
%programming style in a case study of a shopping cart.}

%Recent research has explored using Datalog-based
%languages to express a distributed system as a set of logical
%invariants~\cite{boom-eurosys,loo-sigmod06}.  Two properties of distributed
%systems proved difficult to model in Datalog.  First, the state of any such system
%evolves with its execution.  Second, deductions in these systems may be
%arbitrarily delayed, dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links
%they must traverse.  Previous efforts addressed the former by extending
%Datalog to include updates, key constraints, persistence and events, and
%the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay.
%These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which increases the complexity of
%the language or its interpretation, and forces programmers to
%think operationally.  We argue that the missing component from these previous
%languages is a notion of {\em time}.

%In this paper we present {\bf \lang}, a foundation language for programming and
%reasoning about distributed systems.  \lang reduces to a subset of
%Datalog~\cite{ullmanbook} with negation, aggregate functions, successor and
%choice \wrm{cite?}.  \lang also admits an explicit representation of logical
%time.
%
%We show that \lang provides a declarative foundation for the two signature
%features of distributed systems: mutable state, and asynchronous processing and
%communication.  
%%Given these two features, we address three important properties
%%of programs in a domain-specific manner: a notion of {\em safety} appropriate
%%to non-terminating computations, {\em stratified} monotonic reasoning with
%%negation over time, and efficient evaluation over time via a simple execution
%%strategy.  
%Given these features, we illustrate how powerful verification techniques from the
%Datalog literature may be preserved or reinterpreted in the new domain, including 
%conservative syntactic checks for a notion of {\em safety} appropriate to 
%non-terminating computation, and {\em stratified} monotonic reasoning with negation 
%over time.
%%We also provide conservative syntactic checks for our temporal
%%notions of safety and stratification.  
%We also explore the use of similar static analysis techniques to verify properties unique 
%to systems with asynchronous communication, including commutativity and idempotence
%of in-flight messages.
%Our experience implementing
%full-featured systems in variants of Datalog suggests that \lang is well-suited
%to the specification of rich distributed services and protocols, and provides
%both cleaner semantics and richer tests of correctness.
