\begin{abstract}
Manipulating the ordering and batching of data for increased performance
of algorithms and systems is a time-honored tradition in computer science.
For instance, Codd's {\em order independence} underlies much of the
fields of query optimization and parallel databases, and is also implemented
in distributed systems such as MapReduce's {\em combiner} phase for partial merging.
The idea has a long tradition in algorithm design as well, for example in
deterministic {\em Las Vegas algorithms}, which employ randomness to break
the correlation between input instances and performance.  
These constructs and programming paradigms are widespread and helpful, but,
given a program, it is often hard to understand where reordering or introducing
disorder will preserve determinism.  Furthermore, the ordering aspect of
programs is too often a {\em cross-cutting concern}---changing the ordering
properties of a program involves changes to many modules or components.
We propose a programming language that decomposes algorithms
into ``algebra'' and ``ordering,'' in the vein of Kowalski's famous ``Algorithm
= Logic + Control'' formulation.  In our language, a programmer writes a
specification in ``algebra;'' the program's performance characteristics can
then be tuned without affecting its meaning by changing only the ``ordering.''
Our language
fosters a design pattern where programmers are dissuaded from adding
unnecessary ordering to the ``algebra'' specification; they are induced
to proactively write order-independent code so that the
order may later be customized.  We present the notion of ``timelines'' as an
interface between ``algebra'' and ``ordering:'' the ``ordering'' can be any
arbitrary code that produces a ``timeline,'' whereas the ``algebra'' is
restricted to ensure that program outcomes are independent of the
``ordering.''  We formally prove this property of our language and
demonstrate its applicability by considering a variety of case studies.
