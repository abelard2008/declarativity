\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relwork}
The shopping cart case study in Section~\ref{sec:case} was motivated by the
Amazon Dynamo paper~\cite{dynamo}, as well as the related discussion by Helland
and Campbell~\cite{quicksand}. Systems with loose consistency requirements have
been explored in depth by both the systems and database management communities,
most notably X, Y, and Z.

There is a long history of attempts to design programming languages more
suitable to parallel and distributed systems; for example, Argus~\cite{argus}
and Linda~\cite{linda}.

The Bloom language is inspired by earlier work that attempts to integrate
databases and programming languages, such as Gem~\cite{gem} and
object-relational mapping systems.
