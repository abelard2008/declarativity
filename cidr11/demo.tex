\section{Demo Proposal}
\label{sec:demo}

The goal of our demonstration will be to illustrate the basic concepts of the
Bloom programming language, and in particular to show how our program analysis
techniques assist in the development of distributed software. We will
demonstrate how to use Bloom to develop several variants of a distributed
shopping cart system, similar to the case study described in
Section~\ref{sec:case}.

We will begin by developing the destructive and disorderly variants of the
shopping cart example, initially without any coordination logic. We will run
these programs on a cluster of laptops, interconnected via wireless
networking. One laptop will serve as the client, submitting requests to add or
remove items from the cart.  The rest of the laptops will function as server
replicas.  The client will dispatch each request to a random server replica.
For demonstration purposes, we will interpose a demonic message delivery module,
which operates at each server replica and delivers messages in a random ``bad''
order (e.g., deletions before insertions, checkouts before all insertions
and deletions).

We will display a trace of the cart's execution in real time by visualizing the
messages sent by the client and received by each server replica, in the order
they are sent or received, and explain the potential hazards associated with
different orders. We will then apply our points-of-order program analysis, and
show how this technique identifies the possible message ordering inconsistencies
we have already demonstrated experimentally.

Finally, we will add coordination logic to the two shopping cart variants, and
then run the modified code on the cluster of laptops. We will benchmark the
performance of the modified shopping cart programs and visualize the results,
demonstrating how the increased coordination in the destructive shopping cart
implementation results in reduced performance. To ensure that this effect is
visible, we may need to ensure the network has some amount of latency. The
conference WiFi may be sufficiently congested to serve this purpose, or else we
may need to bring our own networking equipment and instrument it to add the
appropriate amount of latency.
