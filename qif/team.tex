\section{Student Team}

Designing a novel language and implementing an efficient runtime require a broad base of skills.  Our team takes advantage of the 
diversity of experience and interests in the UC Berkeley Database research team.  

Neil Conway is a Postgres developer who worked at the stream processing company Truviso prior to beginning his graduate studies.  He brings
his extensive experience in the design an implementation of both traditional database systems and high-performance stream processors
to the Bloom project.  Neil is the architect and lead developer of \emph{C4}, for which a prototype runtime already exists, and Blossom.   

Peter Alvaro's background in logic and proof systems provides the formal foundations of our work.  He created the \emph{Dedalus} language
upon which the unambiguous semantics of \emph{Bloom} will be based.  Peter is currently working on verifying systems implemented in \emph{Dedalus}
via a custom model checker that takes advantage of the high-level logical specification of distributed programs.
