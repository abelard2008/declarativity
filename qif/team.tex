\section{Student Team}
This project combines elements of both systems and theory, and hence requires a
heterogenous collection of skills. We believe that we have the experience needed
to implement the proposal described above.

Peter Alvaro's background in logic and proof systems provides the formal
foundations of our work.  Peter is the primary designer of the Dedalus language,
which forms the semantic foundation of Bloom.  He is currently working on
verifying systems implemented in \emph{Dedalus} via a custom model checker that
takes advantage of the high-level logical specification of distributed programs.

Neil Conway is an experienced system architect, and leads the systems research
required for this project. After spending five years as a major developer of the
PostgreSQL relational database system, Neil was an early employee at Truviso, a
stream processing company spun out of research at UC Berkeley. Neil is the lead
designer and implementor of both C4 and Blossom.
